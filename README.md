# Front-end for a movie database
A web front-end for a movies database of two related tables, 'Movie' and 'Actor'; I used php, html, css, javascript and sql to develop and design the interface.

This is a skeleton front-end with the usernames/passwords/hosts replaced with a placeholder, but demonstrations can be seen below.
